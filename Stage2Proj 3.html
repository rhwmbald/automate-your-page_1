          <p>
            When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

            HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>CSS</em> which describes "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This video</a> gives a good overview

          <p>
            Computers do only what they are told because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
          </p>
          <p>
            So you need to be a better programmer because <span class="c_green">Garbage in = Garbage out</span>.

          <p>
            HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

            The <span class="c_green"> "tree-like structure" </span> comes from the fact that HTML elements can branch off. In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes.

          <p>
            Repetition wastes alot of time and can cause many mistakes. If a change is need later, it is easier. Only a single place will need to be changed instead of hundreds. Therefore, less support is needed which makes easier and faster to maintain.

            Standardization can be had by using the class in different parts of a web page. One style will control them all.

            A computer program is used to do tasks that would require manual repetition so that it is efficient and effective.  A computer will follow the instructions in a program to accomplish a specific task.  There are many programs but the one we will use is called Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strings and Variables are an essential part of most programming languages and is a way to pass inputs into the program.  Strings hold alphanumeric characters like <span class="c_green"> text='Hello' or text ='2' </span>  and are in quotes.  Variables are assigned a value and the value can be reassigned.  Assignment of a value in Python, happens in a line like <span class="c_green"> counter = 100 </span>  were counter is assigned a number of 100.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The equal sign can mean different things.  in a line of code <span class="c_green"> 4-1=3 </span> , the equal sign means the same as. However in a line of code <span class="c_green"> counter=100 </span>, the equal means take the value of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables are very useful in programming.  Variables are given names that tell what they do so this make the program understandable to others especially programs that have to support it later in time.  They store data and allow the data to be inputs to the other places in the program.

      <div class="summary">
        <div class="sum_title">
          Functions(also called Procedures)
        </div>
        <div class="sum_detail">
          <p>
            Functions are groups of code that manipulate input to produce an output.  A simple function would be to take an income and apply a tax rate to determine the amount of tax owed.  The inputs would be the income and tax rate and the output would be the tax owed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Python, functions start with the word 'def' and the functions name with a colon afterwards.  The body would be the instructions and then the required output would be returned. Using the example above we could do:
          </p>

           <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>1. def tax_owed(inc,tax):</li>
            <li>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amt=0</li>
            <li>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amt = inc * tax</li>
            <li>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return amt</li>
            <li>5. print "Tax Owed is " + str(tax_owed(1000,.1))</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

            The function is tax_owed and it returns 100 (1000*.1).  Then Python prints the string and the function's output for "Tax Owed is 100.0"
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a function is defined, it be  used over and over again - helping to reduce repetition, reduce errors, and save time. If the return was forgotten in the function then a 'None' would be the result.  In Python, letter case and indentions are very important. The <span class="c_green"> != </span>  means not equal and <span class="c_green"> == </span> means equal.  The <span class="c_green"> # </span>  comments out the line of code and three quotes will comment out multiple lines. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Other important concepts are: 
          </p>
          <p>
            If/Else statements allow a selection based on conditions that are met.  An example would be when taxes are only owed if the income is over $5, then an if statment would be needed to check if the income is over $5. If it is then return the tax owed else the function would return zero.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loops allow for block of information to be analyzed to see if the function will apply.  
            A While loops will execute as long as the test expression is valid. It will usually contain at least one if statement and a counter on the while test expression so the while loop will end and not become an infinite loop.
            A For Loop does not need the above because the loop is only being executed on a defined 'List'.  So if we had a list of 10 incomes the were in a 'List'.  The For loop would look at each of the 10 incomes and perform the task in the function.  A Python defined list would look like <span class="c_green"> list_income=[0,1,2,...,9] </span>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Lists are different than strings because they can hold anything like numbers/text and they can be changed. 
            Lists can be Mutations or Alisings.
            Mutations change the list so if a list of 4 strings is appended to add a string then the list increases to 5 strings.  
            Alisings is two different ways to refer to the same object.  In the example in class was a good one -it used two ways to refer to Bond are James Bond and 007.  
            An empty list is <span class="c_green"> list=[] </span>.
